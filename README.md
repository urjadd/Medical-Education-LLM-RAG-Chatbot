# Medical-Education-LLM-RAG-Chatbot

Welcome to the Interactive Medical Education LLM (Lifelong Learning Model) Chatbot project. This project aims to enhance medical education by providing an interactive learning experience through a novel approach called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The chatbot allows medical students to quiz themselves using flashcards based on textbook information to the Llama 2 model, providing a unique and effective learning experience.

## Core Components

### 1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Study LLM
The core feature of this project is the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) study LLM. This allows medical students to quiz themselves using textbooks, promoting active engagement with the study material. The RAG model leverages the power of retrieval-based learning and generative models to enhance the overall learning experience.

### 2. Vector Database
To facilitate efficient retrieval and linking of textbook information to the Llama 2 model, a vector database has been implemented. The vector database plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving information, ensuring a smooth and seamless learning experience for the users.

### 3. Llama 2
The project integrates with Llama 2, a specialized model designed for lifelong learning. This integration enhances the chatbot's capability to provide a unique learning experience by combining the power of retrieval-based learning, generative models, and lifelong learning methodologies.

### 4. Chroma DB Integration
The chatbot utilizes Chroma DB as a vector database, further optimizing the storage and retrieval of information. Chroma DB's capabilities enhance the efficiency of the vector database, contributing to the overall speed and performance of the chatbot.

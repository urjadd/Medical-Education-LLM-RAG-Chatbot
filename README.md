# Interactive Medical Education LLM Chatbot

Welcome to the Interactive Medical Education LLM (Lifelong Learning Model) Chatbot project. This project aims to enhance medical education by providing an interactive learning experience through a novel approach called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The chatbot allows medical students to quiz themselves using flashcards based on textbook information to the Llama 2 model, providing a unique and effective learning experience.

## Core Components

### 1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Study LLM
The core feature of this project is the implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) study LLM. This allows medical students to quiz themselves using textbooks, promoting active engagement with the study material. The RAG model leverages the power of retrieval-based learning and generative models to enhance the overall learning experience.

### 2. Vector Database
To facilitate efficient retrieval and linking of textbook information to the Llama 2 model, a vector database has been implemented. The vector database plays a crucial role in storing and retrieving information, ensuring a smooth and seamless learning experience for the users.

### 3. Llama 2
The project integrates with Llama 2, a specialized model designed for lifelong learning. This integration enhances the chatbot's capability to provide a unique learning experience by combining the power of retrieval-based learning, generative models, and lifelong learning methodologies.

### 4. Chroma DB Integration
The chatbot utilizes Chroma DB as a vector database, further optimizing the storage and retrieval of information. Chroma DB's capabilities enhance the efficiency of the vector database, contributing to the overall speed and performance of the chatbot.
